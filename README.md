# Markerless Motion and/or Pose and/or Face detection and/or tracking and  it's 3D reconstruction (in real time)

# Inspiration:
 * I get chill in my bones when camera captured images turn into 3D virtual characters and their motion into its animation. I want to pursue this feeling.
 * Here is one such [excitement](https://youtu.be/MMa2oT1wMIs) and here is the direct link to the page containing the [paper](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/realtimeperformancecapture/) which is also present in [tum research lab](http://niessnerlab.org/projects/zollhoefer2018facestar.html).
 * Here is [disney research hub youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyResearchHub/videos) and [disney research website](https://www.disneyresearch.com/research/).
 * Here is another such excitement on [Avatar Digitization From a Single Image For Real-Time Rendering](https://youtu.be/dERjpAaoNjk).
 * From University of Bonn on [3D Reconstruction of Human Motion from Video](http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/publications/paper-details/yasin-2013b/).
 * Again from University of Bonn on [3D Pose Estimation from a Single Monocular Image
](http://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/en/publications/paper-details/yasin2015/).

# Get started with:
* With this simple Interesting tutorial on [Head Pose Estimation using OpenCV and Dlib
](https://www.learnopencv.com/head-pose-estimation-using-opencv-and-dlib/). Belive me you will learn a lot for a beginner with this project.
