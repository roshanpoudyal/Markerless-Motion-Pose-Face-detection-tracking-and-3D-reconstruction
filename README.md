# Project is developed as an interest in [Visual Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_computing).
# Markerless Motion and/or Pose and/or Face detection and/or tracking and  it's 3D reconstruction (in real time)

# Inspiration:
 * I get chill in my bones when camera captured images and videos (or live videos) turn into 3D virtual characters and their motion into its animation. I want to pursue this feeling.
 * [What is Visual Computing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_computing).
 * [What is 3D reconstruction?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction). This link gives a basic foundational idea on 3D reconstruction from images. **Using 3D reconstruction one can determine any object’s 3D profile, as well as knowing the 3D coordinate of any point on the profile.** from section **Motivation and applications** from this link is euphoric. Plus the methods for 3D reconstruction and in detail explanation of **Binocular stereo vision** and how it works is beautiful. There are other sources and external link.

# On Computer Graphics:
* You sure will have to know much about computer Graphics too along with Computer Vision.
* Get started with [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials). This will help you understand 3D Graphics programming as well as help you shine your C++ skills.

* Start with this tutorial on [3D scene reconstruction from these set of OpenCV Tutorials called Structure From Motion](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/d7c/tutorial_table_of_content_sfm.html). Make sure you do the tutorials in sequence and make sure the version of this OpenCV docs matches with the version of OpenCV version you are using.

# Future direction:
  * 3D pose estimation
  * 3D motion reconstruction
  * Mapping human motion to 3D models or characters
  
# Final Goal:
 * Reach a level near or far to [Real time face reconstruction as good as this](https://cgl.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/PaperVideos/2012/Bic12-Siggraph2012-PhysicalFaceCloning.mp4). The link to main page of this paper is [here](https://cgl.ethz.ch/publications/papers/paperBic12.php).
