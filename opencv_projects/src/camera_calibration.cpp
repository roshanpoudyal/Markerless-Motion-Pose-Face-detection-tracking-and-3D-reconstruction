    * 
    * Tip : while calibrating camera from live video feed, like we are doing. It was found that if the room was illuminated better, for example in bright daylight,
    *       the chessboard patterns were found easily (I do not have the reason for it now). If you do not have bright sunny day or similar, it can help if you can,
    *       point a direct light to the camera you are using for calibration and then feed the chessboard pattern to the camera.
